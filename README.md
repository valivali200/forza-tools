# forza-tools
Some tools made in python for working with Forza Horizon 5 models and textures.
Right now, there is only a converter for .swatchbin textures, but in the future I wish to add more tools.
There are other closed-source tools out there but I felt like making my own.
I know python is slow and probably isn't the best for this, but it works and in this case, it is reasonably fast.
Each tool has a README of its own and an info.txt file which contains information about the format.

These tools are developed on Linux, but they should work just fine on Windows.
